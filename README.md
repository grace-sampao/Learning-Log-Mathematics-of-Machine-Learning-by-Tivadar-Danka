# 📖 Learning Log: Mathematics of Machine Learning by Tivadar Danka

This repository documents my learning journey as I follow along and apply the concepts from the book [Mathematics of Machine Learning](https://www.packtpub.com/en-us/product/mathematics-of-machine-learning-9781837027866) by [Tivadar Danka](https://tivadardanka.com/about).

> **N/B:** Just got through a few pages in Chapter 1. Looking at other material on this topic, I'll need to study the foundations of Vectors and Vector Spaces such as Linear Algebra and Trigonometry.

For now I'll proceed with going through the book to get a general overview and will flesh out the concepts later.
